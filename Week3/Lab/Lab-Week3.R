######    DRAW CONCLUSIONS   ######
#An initial examination of the relationships between Ride Percentage 
#(RidePer) and Earnings, and Cup Points (CupPoints) and Earnings showed 
#that Cup Points had the 'STRONGER' relationship to Earnings. Ride 
#Percentage and Earnings showed a correlation value of '0.593' while 
#Cup Points and Earnings had a correlation value of '0.657'.

# Visual examination showed an 'OUTLIER'  in both relationshipsâ€”a rider 
#who has earned over 1 million dollars. Removal of this increased the 
#initial relationship: Ride Percentage and Earnings now had a correlation 
#value of '0.804'  and Cup Points and Earnings had a correlation value of
#'0.893'. 'CUP POINTS'  still had the higher relationship to Earnings. 
#Visual examination showed a 'GOOD LINEAR RELATIONSHIP'  for both Ride 
##Percentage and Cup Points, indicating the correct use of the correlation 
#coefficient.
